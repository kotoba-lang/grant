  "The system graph and the derived capability graph, ported from the retired
  `aiueos/src/graph.rs` Rust module to CLJC per ADR-2607022200.

  A system graph is a vector of component manifests (pure EDN maps, each
  validated by `grant.contract/validate-manifest`). From it we derive a
  capability graph mapping each capability to the components exporting it,
  which `grant.policy` uses to resolve imports; and a topological boot order
  / dependency depth, which the (future) scheduler (ADR-0006) uses to order
  and parallelize component startup.

  File loading (`system.aiueos.edn` -> manifests) stays a host adapter
  concern; this namespace only reasons over already-loaded manifest data."

  algorithm traversal in `boot-order` happens to produce.

  PRIORITIES is a vector of ints parallel to COMPONENTS (e.g.
  `(mapv #(get-in % [:aiueos/schedule :aiueos.manifest/priority])
  normalized-manifests)`). This stays a valid topological order: sorting
  primarily by depth keeps every depth-group fully ordered before the
  next (providers strictly precede consumers, since a provider's depth is
  always < its consumer's), and priority only reorders WITHIN a
  depth-group, where `depths` already guarantees no dependency edges
  exist to violate.

  Returns the same shape as `boot-order` (`{:aiueos.graph/order [...]}` or
  `{:aiueos.graph/cycle [...]}`, unchanged on a cycle since there's no
