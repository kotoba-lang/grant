(ns grant.json
  "JSON, narrowly, because the two cloud authorities answer in it.

  `grant.cloud` judges responses; something has to turn the bytes into values
  first. This plane is dependency-minimal on purpose — `deps.edn` carries
  `security` and `abi` and nothing else, and it says why: a decision plane
  behind a third-party parser is a decision plane behind whatever that parser
  decides. Adding a JSON library to read one alias entry would also enlarge the
  TCB `aiueos`'s inventory pins on the other side of the split. So this follows
  the precedent `grant.cloud` set with its inlined base32/CID decoder: the one
  shape that is actually needed, and a refusal for everything else.

  ## It refuses rather than guesses

  Every hazard below is a place a lenient parser silently produces a value,
  and a value is what a decision gets made on:

  - **duplicate object keys** — two answers to the same question, and which
    one survives is the parser's opinion. Refused;
  - **trailing bytes** — `{\"ok\":true} garbage` is not one document, and
    reading the prefix is agreeing with an attacker about where it ended;
  - **`NaN`, `Infinity`, `+1`, `.5`, `01`** — none are JSON. They are refused
    by grammar, not stripped;
  - **an integer past the range this runtime represents exactly** — refused as
    `:number-out-of-range` rather than rounded, because a rounded identifier
    still compares equal to nothing and unequal to everything;
  - **depth and input ceilings** — a bounded document cannot make an unbounded
    parser spend this machine's stack or memory.

  ## Failure is a value, not an exception

  `read-json` returns the parsed value, or a map carrying
  `:grant.json/error`. A parsed JSON object has **string** keys, so it can
  never contain that keyword: `failed?` is unambiguous rather than a
  convention. This matters for the same reason
  `aiueos.provider.cloud`'s faults are a different key from
  `grant.cloud`'s deny reasons — \"there was nothing to decide about\" and
  \"the decision was no\" must not arrive looking alike.

  Object keys stay strings. Interning them as keywords would let a remote
  authority decide what keywords this machine holds, and would silently merge
  `\"a\"` with `:a`."
