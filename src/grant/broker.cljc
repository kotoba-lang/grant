(ns grant.broker
  "The capability broker's decision logic, ported from the retired
  `aiueos/src/broker.rs` Rust module to CLJC per ADR-2607022200.

  This namespace owns the *decisions* the broker makes: whether a component
  is granted capabilities (`verify-one`/`verify-system`), the code-as-data
  admission gate (`verify-admission`, ADR-0004), and pure data assembly for
  `:aiueos/run-plan` / `:aiueos/run-receipt` (matching
  `grant.contract/validate-run-plan` / `validate-run-receipt`).

  This namespace itself deliberately does NOT own execution -- see
  `aiueos.execute` for that (`:provider/execute` in
  `resources/aiueos/broker_contract.edn`'s `:run-receipt` flow). ADR-2607022200
  originally assumed execution was permanently native/Rust territory because
  `.kotoba` compiles TO Wasm and cannot itself host other Wasm components;
  ADR-2607022900 revises that for the JVM case specifically -- `aiueos.execute`
  hosts compiled `.kotoba` Wasm via Chicory (a pure-JVM Wasm runtime), calling
  `verify-one`/`verify-admission` from this namespace first and refusing to run
  anything denied, same contract as before. Raw hardware access (the
  device-access quartet) is still out of scope everywhere. A non-JVM host
  adapter without Chicory available should: call `verify-one`/`verify-admission`
  here (or via `grant.decide`'s subprocess bridge), only proceed to execute on
  `:aiueos/decision :grant`, then call `run-receipt` with the execution result
  to shape the audited receipt.

  Every function here is pure: no file I/O, no wall-clock reads. Where the
  retired Rust broker appended directly to an `AuditLog`, these functions
  instead return `:aiueos.broker/audit-entries` — a vector of pure
  `grant.audit/audit-entry` maps — for the caller (a host adapter) to
  append via `grant.audit/append!`. This mirrors the pure/impure split
  `grant.audit` itself already draws.

  One retired module is deliberately NOT ported here or anywhere:
  `aiueos/src/safe.rs`, the safe-kotoba subset gate (denies eval/require/
  reflection/host construction before compiling `:aiueos/source`). It is
  redundant, not merely out of scope — `kotoba-lang/kotoba`'s own
  `kototama`/`kotoba-clj` compiler layer already owns this exact check
  (`kotoba-lang/kotoba/src/kotoba/runtime.clj`), and `kotoba-lang/kotoba`'s
  `ADR-kotoba-shell-aiueos-safety-clj.md` formalizes the split: kototama
  gates the *language* (is this source safe to compile at all?), aiueos
  gates *capabilities* over the manifest and the resulting artifact (this
  namespace + `grant.policy`). A host adapter compiling `:aiueos/source`
  should call kototama's safety gate first, then this namespace's
  `verify-one`/`verify-admission` — porting a second denylist here would
  duplicate, and risk drifting from, kototama's."
