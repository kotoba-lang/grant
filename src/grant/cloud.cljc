  "The two remote authorities ADR-0041 names — kotobase for storage,
  murakumo for inference — expressed as decisions.

  Contract: `resources/aiueos/cloud_contract.edn`. Nothing here opens a socket.
  A plan is a request this policy would allow, and an admission is a verdict
  about a response a provider already received. Transport is provider
  mechanism, exactly as in `grant.ota`.

  ## The holes this namespace closes

  **A CID is a claim about bytes, and a response is bytes.** `plan-block-read`
  carries the digest the CID commits to, and `admit-block` refuses a response
  whose observed digest differs. A provider that cannot say what it hashed gets
  `:digest-missing` — silence is not a pass, because a check that could not run
  must not return the value of a check that ran and found nothing wrong.

  **kotobase's `PUT /ipfs/:cid` accepts raw CIDv1 only** (root ADR-2608148200).
  An object whose identity CID is dag-cbor is archived under the *raw* CID of
  the same bytes. Refusing that before the request is the difference between a
  decision and a collected 400.

  **The model alias is a redirect.** `murakumo-main` resolves through a mutable
  KV entry to an endpoint, so an allowlist that admitted `api.murakumo.cloud`
  would otherwise authorise whatever host that entry names next. `admit-model`
  re-checks the resolved endpoint against the same allowlist that admitted the
  resolver.

  **`alias-for` is not the model to request.** Sending the concrete id the alias
  currently points at freezes this machine at whatever was serving the moment it
  resolved — precisely what root ADR-2607173100 forbids. The request carries the
  alias; an override that equals `alias-for` is refused rather than honoured.

  ## What this does not do

  It does not put aiueos on the network. The bare-metal profile has no DNS, no
  TLS and no HTTP client (ADR-0041's gap ledger, steps 1–5); this is the
  decision layer those steps will be wired underneath, and it is checkable
  before any of them exist."

  ## When the resolution names no endpoint

  A resolution with no endpoint is `:alias-unresolved`, and that is the

  the murakumo worker resolves the alias server-side, so a caller may POST to
  the inference origin with `model: \"murakumo-main\"` and never need an
  endpoint at all — which makes \"treat a missing endpoint as the configured
  origin\" a *correct* reading and a **silent** one. Silent is the problem. A
  machine that reaches an origin because a field was absent has been authorised
  by an omission.

  So the fallback exists and is off. `:aiueos.cloud/endpoint-from-origin?` in
  policy turns it on, and the admission records
  `:aiueos.cloud/endpoint-source` — `:resolved` or `:configured-origin` — so a

  Three outcomes have to stay distinguishable, and a namespace that collapsed
  them would be the defect root ADR-2608136000 names:

  - **the provider could not measure** — no status at all, because the request
    faulted. `:response-unmeasured`. It is not a refusal; there was nothing
    to refuse;
  - **the model returned nothing** — a 200 whose body carries no completion
    text. `:completion-empty`;
  - **it worked** — an allow carrying the text, its length, and the stop
    reason.

  A non-200 is `:response-not-ok` with the status, which is where an
  un-credentialed request to the gated surface lands:
  `POST https://api.murakumo.cloud/v1/messages` answered 401 on 2026-08-21. A
  body that is not JSON is `:body-unparsable` with the reader's own reason,
  rather than an empty completion — \"could not read it\" and \"read it and it
  was empty\" are different facts.

  Two more refusals exist because the answer shape is **declared by the plan**
  rather than sniffed from the body (see `response-shapes`):

  - `:response-shape-unknown` — the plan targeted a path this namespace has no
    reader for. It is refused before the body is looked at, because a machine
    that cannot say what document it asked for cannot judge the one it got;
  - `:response-shape-mismatch` — the declared shape's container is absent. The
    authority sent a different kind of document, which is not the same event as
    the model returning nothing, and a lenient reader reports the two
    identically."
