(ns grant.decide
  "The decision subprocess entry point (ADR-2607022700): a process a native
  host adapter (kototama tender) shells out to instead of ever computing
  capability decisions itself. Reads one EDN request per line from stdin,
  dispatches through `grant.cli/command-result`, writes one EDN response
  per line to stdout.

  Mirrors the newline-delimited wire protocol already proven by
  `examples/computer/backing/surface.mjs` (ADR-0007) in the retired Rust
  crate -- applied here to capability decisions instead of computer-use
  actions. A native tender is expected to shell out to this process
  per-invocation (`bb decide`) as its V1 integration; a long-lived process
  talking newline-delimited EDN over a persistent pipe is a later
  optimization, not implemented here.

  Request shape (one EDN map per stdin line):
    {:aiueos.decide/command <command-id keyword, e.g. :verify>
     :aiueos.decide/request <already-parsed EDN request map -- see
                             grant.cli's namespace docstring for the
                             :aiueos/manifest / :aiueos/components /
                             :aiueos/policy-overlay / :aiueos/surface-id
                             shapes each command expects>}

  Response (one EDN map per stdout line): whatever
  `grant.cli/command-result` returns for that command, unmodified -- or a
  `{:aiueos.decide/error ...}` map if the request line itself was malformed
  EDN or missing `:aiueos.decide/command`."
