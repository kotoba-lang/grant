  "Update planning and step admission — the decision half of \"update it without
  taking the customer down\".

  Contract: `resources/aiueos/update_contract.edn`. Pure decisions only; the
  fetching, writing, rebooting and draining are provider mechanism.

  ## \"Zero downtime\" is three different claims, and only two are free

  What can be swapped without stopping the service depends on what changed:

  | changed | class | service downtime |
  |---|---|---|
  | a component (WASM) | `:live` | none — admission already re-decides per component |
  | a guest (the inference appliance) | `:blue-green` | none — start the new one, health-gate it, drain the old |
  | kernel or loader | `:ab-reboot` | one reboot |

  The A/B partition flow this repository already proves (primary ESP + a
  byte-identical recovery partition, an update receipt, and a rollback the
  release smoke executes in both directions) is the `:ab-reboot` mechanism. It
  is atomic and reversible, but it is not free of a reboot, and claiming
  otherwise would be the kind of thing this repository writes ADRs about.

  What *is* achievable for a fleet member is continuity of the **service**
  rather than of the process: fleet work drains to other nodes before the
  reboot, so the customer's own agents are the only thing that can be
  interrupted — which is why `:ab-reboot` requires either an idle machine, a
  maintenance window, or explicit consent, and never proceeds on \"probably
  fine\".

  ## Every step is gated by evidence that can fail

  `admit-step` refuses to advance on a missing health answer the same way
  `grant.enroll/claim` refuses to decide without a possession proof. A health
  probe that cannot fail is not a gate, and an update flow whose gate cannot
  fail is a flow that installs anything."
