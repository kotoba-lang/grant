(ns grant.manifest
  "The manifest normalizer, ported from the retired `aiueos/src/manifest.rs`
  Rust module to CLJC per ADR-2607022200.

  `grant.contract/validate-manifest` is the pure SHAPE authority: it checks
  that a raw `:aiueos/*` EDN map has the right keys with the right coarse
  types (e.g. `:aiueos/limits` has positive-integer `:memory-pages`/`:fuel`).
  This namespace is the *normalizer*: given a manifest map that is already
  shape-valid, fill in every default, derive every computed field, and hand
  back a fully-explicit manifest — no more implicit defaults for
  `grant.policy/verify-component` or `grant.broker` to guess at.

  Concretely, `normalize`:

  - Defaults `:aiueos/trust` by `:aiueos/kind` (`:agent` -> `:ai-generated`,
    `:kernel-extension` -> `:trusted`, everything else -> `:untrusted`) —
    strictly more refined than `grant.policy/verify-component`'s own
    unconditional `:untrusted` fallback for a missing `:aiueos/trust`.
    Calling `normalize` before `grant.policy/verify-component` makes that
    coarser fallback correct (trust is already explicit by then).
  - Defaults and range-checks `:aiueos/limits` and `:aiueos/quota`
    (ADR-0006) — the one thing `grant.contract/validate-manifest`
    intentionally leaves to this namespace, since it only checks *type*
    (positive integer), not the semantic ceiling (e.g. wasm32's 65536-page /
    4 GiB memory ceiling).
  - Derives `:aiueos/schedule` from raw millisecond fields to cycle counts
    (ADR-0006's cooperative scheduler has no wall clock).
  - Derives `:aiueos/publishes` / `:aiueos/subscribes` from
    `:aiueos/exports` / `:aiueos/imports` + `:aiueos/topics` when not given
    explicitly.

  `signed-message` and `with-trust` are the small ADR-0003 signing helpers
  the retired `Manifest` struct carried as methods.

  `verify-wasm-integrity` is the ADR-0003 artifact-integrity check
  (\"Phase-0 gives integrity: a manifest may declare `:aiueos/wasm-sha256`
  and the broker rejects the component if the loaded bytes don't match\")
  -- a pure string comparison against an already-computed hash, so it stays
  host-neutral even though the SHA-256 computation itself (over the actual
  loaded wasm bytes) is necessarily a JVM/host-adapter concern (see
  `grant.signing/sha256-hex`, consumed by `aiueos.execute`)."
