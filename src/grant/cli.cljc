(ns grant.cli
  "CLJC authority for the aiueos CLI contract, mirroring
  `kotoba-lang/kotoba-lang`'s `kotoba.cli` pattern (ADR-2607022200) so aiueos
  gets the same split: this namespace owns the command contract loading,
  request shaping, and command result model; host binaries (the retired
  Rust `aiueos/src/bin/aiueos.rs`, or any future JVM/Node/native launcher)
  are adapters that consume `resources/aiueos/cli.edn` and
  `grant.cli/dispatch` instead of defining command semantics
  independently.

  `command-result` takes ALREADY-PARSED EDN values (a manifest map, a
  components vector, a policy overlay map -- never a bare file path):
  reading `--policy foo.edn` off disk and handing this namespace the parsed
  EDN is the host adapter's job, exactly like every other namespace in this
  repo (`grant.contract`, `grant.broker`, ...) stays host-neutral. This
  keeps `grant.cli` `.cljc`-portable (JVM/CLJS/kotoba-Wasm), not JVM-only.

  Each command in `resources/aiueos/cli.edn` declares a `:coverage`:
  - `:full` -- computed entirely here (`verify`, `inspect`, `surface`,
    `audit`'s query shape).
  - `:decision-only` -- the grant/deny decision is computed here
    (`admit`, `run`, `up`); executing a `:grant`ed component is a native
    host-adapter concern (ADR-2607022200 Layer 3), flagged via
    `:aiueos/host-action :adapter-required`.
  - `:adapter-only` -- no CLJC decision role (`sign`, `check`, `compile`,
    `hash`, `image`, `vm`) -- `check`/`compile` delegate to
    kototama/kotoba-clj (see `grant.broker`'s namespace docstring), `sign`
    is key-custody tooling, `image`/`vm` are native provisioning."
