(ns grant.audit
  "The append-only audit log, ported from the retired `aiueos/src/audit.rs`
  Rust module to CLJC per ADR-2607022200.

  Every capability decision (grant/deny) and every component lifecycle event
  (compile/run/reject) is appended as one EDN map per line, so the log is
  itself \"kotoba\" -- queryable with the same reader as everything else.

  The five audit events are plain keywords matching
  `grant.contract/audit-events` (`:grant :deny :compile :run :reject`)
  exactly, so there is no separate enum to port -- callers just use the
  keywords directly, the way the rest of this repo keeps `:aiueos/*` data
  the shared vocabulary between CLJC and host adapters.

  `audit-entry` is pure EDN construction: no I/O, no ambient wall-clock
  dependence, portable to any host (JVM, JS, kotoba-Wasm). File I/O
  (`log-path`, `append!`, `read-log`) is inherently a JVM/host adapter
  concern -- not portable to CLJS/kotoba-Wasm -- so it is `#?(:clj ...)`
  gated, following the `grant.contract/load-component-boundary` pattern."

  produces must validate against `grant.contract/validate-audit-event`.

  - `event` -- one of `:grant :deny :compile :run :reject`
