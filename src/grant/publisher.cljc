  "Publisher trust and revocation — the decision half of \"this release may
  become the running system\".

  Contract: `resources/aiueos/publisher_contract.edn`. Pure decisions; fetching,
  signature verification and status-list retrieval are provider mechanism. This
  namespace consumes *verified* counts and flags, never raw signatures, for the
  same reason `grant.enroll` consumes a verified possession proof.

  ## Why this namespace has to exist before OTA does

  ADR-2608012050 declined binary-cache substitution with a condition attached:
  it may be taken up once *publisher trust and revocation are modelled to the
  same standard as component admission*. An OTA path is exactly that
  substitution, so the condition is now load-bearing. Shipping \"signed updates\"
  without the rest fixes a distribution channel that has no way to say a key is
  no longer trusted — which is the failure that matters, because the signature
  keeps verifying after the key is stolen.

  ## The four questions, and the attack each one answers

  A release is admitted only when all four hold. They are separate because they
  fail separately, and a design that collapses them loses an attack:

  1. **threshold** — at least `k` of the publisher keys named by the current
     root signed this release. Answers: one stolen key.
  2. **revocation** — none of the signing keys is revoked. Answers: a key stolen
     *before* it was known to be stolen, whose old signatures are still valid.
  3. **monotonic sequence** — the release's sequence exceeds the installed one.
     Answers: rollback to a version whose bug is now public.
  4. **freshness** — a short-lived timestamp statement covers this release.
     Answers: freeze — an attacker who simply stops delivering updates, which no
     signature check can detect because nothing invalid was ever presented.

  Roles are named as in TUF, deliberately: the threat model is the same one, and
  inventing new names for it would hide that this is a solved problem being
  reused rather than a new scheme being improvised.

  ## Where the pieces live

  This namespace decides. The revocation bitmap is a
  `org-w3-vc-bitstring-status-list` document; the release manifest and its
  artifacts are content-addressed blocks; ordering across publishers is inga's
  job. None of those are reimplemented here.

  ## Freshness on a machine that may have no clock

  `state` may carry a `:clock` from `grant.clock/resolve-time`. When it does,
  freshness is decided there, and its third answer is honoured: a machine that
  can neither accept nor reject **denies the release** with
  `:freshness-undecidable`. It does not fall through to admitting one, and it
  does not report `:timestamp-expired` as though a measurement had been taken.
  Without a `:clock`, `:now-ms` is used directly — which is the hosted profile,
  where a wall clock exists."
