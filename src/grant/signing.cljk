  "Manifest authenticity -- ed25519 verification of signed manifests
  (ADR-0003), ported from the retired `aiueos/src/signing.rs` Rust module to
  CLJC per ADR-2607022200.

  A signature attests \"component `<id>` is exactly these bytes, vouched for
  by this signer\" -- it covers the canonical signed message: the component
  id, a newline, then the wasm sha256 hex digest (see `signed-message`). The
  signer is resolved to a public key via the policy signer registry
  (`:aiueos.policy/signers`, as produced by `grant.policy/parse-policy`).
  This namespace does verification only; signing (key custody) lives in
  tooling, not here.

  `verify` returns ONE of two different map shapes -- the idiomatic Clojure
  stand-in for Rust's `Result<SigStatus, Violation>`:

  - a signing-status map: `{:aiueos.signing/status :unsigned}` (no
    `:aiueos/signature` -- policy decides whether that's allowed to run) or
    `{:aiueos.signing/status :verified :aiueos.signing/signer signer-id}`
    (signature checked out against a registered signer's key).
  - a violation map: `{:aiueos/component id :aiueos/kind :bad-signature
    :aiueos/message \"...\"}`, the SAME shape `grant.policy`'s private
    `violation` helper builds, so a caller can drop it straight into a
    policy-decision's `:aiueos/violations` vector alongside
    `grant.policy/verify-component`'s own violations.

  Use `violation?` to tell the two shapes apart: a violation map always has
  `:aiueos/kind`, a status map never does. A bad signature is NEVER
  downgraded to `:unsigned` -- a forged attestation is worse than none, so
  every deny path here returns a violation, never a status map.

  The actual Ed25519 verify call is JVM-only (`java.security.Signature`,
  algorithm string `\"Ed25519\"`, JDK 15+, no external crypto dependency) and
  is `#?(:clj ...)` gated, following the same host-adapter-boundary pattern
  as `grant.contract`'s `load-*` functions and `grant.audit`'s file-I/O
  functions. CLJS/other hosts wanting to verify signatures need their own
  adapter for that one step; `hex-decode`, `hex-encode`, `signed-message`,
  and the unsigned/no-signer/unregistered-signer/no-wasm-sha256 deny paths
  are pure CLJC and work on every host."
