  This is admission-time scoping. It decides WHETHER the grant may be made at

  "Capabilities available to manifest `m`, presented by `signer` (the
  `:aiueos.broker/signer` `grant.broker/authenticate` resolved a valid
  signature to, or `nil` for an unsigned component / a caller with no
  authentication context): kernel primitives ∪ explicit grants. With an
  active surface (ADR-0005), the kernel primitives are restricted to those
  the surface can actually back — an import that maps to an unoffered
  kernel cap becomes :unresolved-capability (the host refuses to provide
  what this surface shouldn't). Explicit grants are never surface-gated.

  ADR-0012 (2026-07-13): `id`'s elevated grant (`extra`, from
  `:aiueos.policy/grants`) is gated against `:aiueos.policy/component-signers`
  ({component-id -> #{authorized signer-id ...}}), fixing the prior gap
  where ANY registered signer could claim ANY component id's grants (`:aiueos.policy/signers`
  is a flat registry with no per-id restriction on its own).

  - `id` BOUND (has a `component-signers` entry): `extra` applies only when
    `signer` is a member of that entry's set — enforced unconditionally,
    independent of `:aiueos.policy/require-signed` (an explicit binding
    declaration is meant to be honored, not silently inert under a
    permissive policy).
  - `id` UNBOUND (no `component-signers` entry): under
    `:aiueos.policy/require-signed` false, `extra` applies via the bare-id
    lookup unchanged (today's behavior — no identity to bind against is
    ever established for callers who don't require one). Under
    `require-signed` true, `extra` does NOT apply (capability-security
    default: no ambient authority — an operator who wants cryptographic
    identity guarantees does not get them undermined by an id nobody
    bothered to bind).

  Either way, failing the check means `base` only (no elevated grant), the
  same non-hard-deny shape an unrecognized id already gets — not a new
