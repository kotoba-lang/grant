  "Device identity and QR pairing — the decision half of \"power it on, scan the
  label, and it is yours\".

  Contract: `resources/aiueos/enroll_contract.edn`. Every function here is a
  pure decision over data a caller has already gathered; nothing in this
  namespace generates a key, reads a device, or talks to a network. The
  mechanism side (entropy, storage, transport) lives in providers, per the
  ADR-2607241100 split.

  ## The shape of the problem

  A label QR is *static and photographable*. Anything it carries is public the
  moment the box leaves the factory, so the QR may not carry a secret that by
  itself grants control. What makes a claim safe is not the token's secrecy but
  **the window in which the token is answerable**:

  - the token is only answerable while the device is in `:factory` state;
  - the first successful claim moves the device to `:claimed`, and from then on
    the same token is refused (`:already-claimed`);
  - returning to `:factory` requires physical evidence (the reset the operator
    performs on the machine), which a photograph cannot supply.

  So a stolen photo is worth something only against a box that has never been
  claimed and is reachable — and worth nothing the instant the owner claims it.
  That is the same commissioning model consumer device standards converged on,
  and it is chosen here for the same reason.

  ## Two trust grades, never conflated

  `:attested` — the factory provisioned a per-device factory key and issued a
  certificate over (factory public key, hardware serial, model). The device's
  *operational* key is generated on first boot and self-registered under the
  factory key, so the private half never exists outside the device and the
  device's provenance is still checkable.

  `:tofu` — no factory attestation is available; the first claim is trusted on
  first use. This is a real degradation and is reported as such in the verdict
  rather than being smoothed over. A caller that requires provenance rejects a
  `:tofu` grant; a caller that does not may accept it knowingly."
