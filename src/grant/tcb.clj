(ns grant.tcb
  "The trusted-computing-base record for this repository, and the check that
  keeps it true.

  Three properties, each of which was a real defect somewhere else first:

  - **Digests.** Trusted code cannot change without the record changing. Same
    mechanism `aiueos.tcb` uses; this repository's files were nineteen entries
    in that inventory until the split (root ADR-2608219500).

  - **Completeness.** A file in `src/` with no entry is an error. Everything
    here is authority code, so a curated inventory would only be an argument
    waiting to happen -- and the failure mode of curation is silent: a new
    namespace is simply not listed, and nothing is wrong until it is.

  - **Pins.** Recorded external pins are compared with the ones `deps.edn`
    resolves. `kototama.tcb` asked only whether a boundary HAD a pin, and
    measured 2026-08-22 three of its six recorded pins were wrong -- one of
    them naming a SHA `deps.edn` had not pinned for weeks -- while its suite
    stayed green. `:external-to-deps true` marks the boundaries that are not
    Clojure dependencies at all; it is required rather than inferred from
    absence, because a coordinate with a typo is also absent."
