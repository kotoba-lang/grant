  "How the pin set gets to a device, and how it changes.

  Contract: `resources/aiueos/anchors_contract.edn`. Pure decisions; fetching
  and signature verification are provider mechanism, as in `grant.publisher`.

  ## The hole this namespace closes

  ADR-0044 made an https peer trustworthy only if its key is in
  `:aiueos.cloud/trust-anchors`. It recorded no pin for anything real, which
  left the machine strictly worse off than before: **a pinning client with no
  pin distribution is a client that cannot connect.** This is the distribution.

  ## It is a release, so it is admitted like one

  An anchor set is a signed, sequenced document that changes what the machine
  will trust — the same shape as a release, with the same four attacks against
  it (one stolen key, a key stolen before it was known to be, rollback to a set
  whose key is now public, and freeze). `grant.publisher` already answers all
  four, so this namespace **composes** it rather than growing a second, weaker
  copy. Publisher reasons pass through unchanged, for the reason `grant.ota`
  gives: a caller reading a verdict should not have to guess which layer
  refused.

  ## What is true of anchor sets and of nothing else

  **An empty set is not a permissive set, it is a brick.** A machine whose pin
  set is empty reaches nothing, so a perfectly signed empty set is refused —
  the one denial that protects the fleet from its own publisher.

  **Replacing every anchor at once is a one-way door.** If the new keys are
  wrong, the machine cannot reach anything to be told so, including the
  correction. So an ordinary rotation must **overlap**: keep at least one key
  that works today, ship the new one alongside it, switch the server, retire
  the old one. Three admitted sets, none of which can strand a device.

  A compromise cannot overlap — dropping the stolen key is the entire point.
  That path exists, is called `:break-glass?`, needs **every** root key rather
  than the threshold, and the verdict says `:one-way? true` so the operator is
  told what they are doing. Break-glass also drops the previous set
  *immediately* rather than keeping it through the overlap window, because a
  window in which the stolen key still works is the thing being escaped.

  ## Trust on first use is not available

  A device with no anchors cannot be handed one over a connection it has no way
  to judge. The first set ships **in the image**, covered by the release
  signature that already exists, and is marked `:bootstrap?`. Anything else
  arriving at a device with no current set is refused with `:no-current-set`.

  ## A machine that cannot fetch keeps what it has

  `keep-using?` mirrors `grant.publisher/keep-running?` and for the same
  reason: expiring the pin set because an anchor server is unreachable would
  turn a network outage into a fleet outage. Freshness gates **admission of a
  new set**, never continued use of the current one."

;; ── two sequence spaces, two keys ──────────────────────────────────────────

;; Anchor sets and releases are both sequenced, and both are checked by
;; `grant.publisher`, which reads `:installed-sequence`. If a caller keeps one
;; state map for both -- which is the obvious thing to do, since the root keys
;; and revocation bitmap really are shared -- then the higher of the two
;; numbers silently blocks the other stream, and a rollback arrives looking
;; like an upgrade. So anchor state carries its own key and this namespace
