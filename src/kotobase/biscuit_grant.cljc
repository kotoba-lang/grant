  "What a kotobase-issued Biscuit says, once its chain has been checked.

  One implementation, two deployables. `authn` mints these and layers
  tenant/role policy on top; the API gateway only needs to know whether a
  bearer may write, and must be able to decide that **without any secret** --
  that is the whole reason the credential is a Biscuit and not a shared
  string. Both read the token through here, so there is no second answer to
  drift away from the first.

  Deliberately narrower than `authn.biscuit/verify`: no roles, no tenants,
  no viewer. Signature chain, expiry, holder, scopes. A caller that needs
  more asks for more; a caller that needs less must not have to import a
  policy it does not enforce.

  No crypto and no clock: `verify-fn` and `now-ms` are injected."

(defn permits?
  "Does this grant reach `permission`?

  `permission` is either a full resource -- `itonami://can/mcp:tools` -- or a
  bare action, which is read under `permission-prefix` so that every caller
  written before other apexes existed keeps working unchanged.

  ## Why this asks `authority.scope/covers?`

  It used to answer by membership in a set of strings built by cutting
  `kotoba://can/` off the front of each scope. That is a decision, and
  ADR-2608155000 puts the decision in exactly one place: `authority`'s
  partial order. Two things followed from making it here instead.

  The wildcard was lost. Measured 2026-08-31: a token carrying
  `kotoba://can/*` renders, strips to `*`, and fails set membership against
  `data:read` -- so a holder of a deliberately broad grant was refused, and
  the old docstring's claim that there is no widening to guard against was
  true only because widening had already been discarded. `covers?` restores
  it: a trailing `:*` reaches any strictly longer scope sharing the prefix.

  And the apex could not vary. ADR-2608311600 fixes the capability scheme at
  `<apex>://can/<action>`, and `authority.scope/parse` already puts the apex
  in segment 0 -- so nothing needs a per-apex constant or a per-apex
  argument. The prefixes below become a convenience for one apex's callers
  rather than the mechanism.

  Cross-apex separation is the property this must not lose, and it is the
  partial order's: `kotoba://can/*` does not reach `itonami://can/anything`,
  because the schemes differ in segment 0."

(defn permits-object?
  "Does this grant reach the object at `cid`?

  **A grant with no object scope reaches every object.** That is not a hole
  left open: it is what every token minted before this prefix existed looks
  like, and ADR-2608262600 chose addition over rotation precisely so that
  holders are not silently locked out by a change they did not ask for. A
  grant that carries one or more object scopes must name this one.

  So the narrowing is done by the holder, offline: take a broad token, append
  a block carrying `kotoba://object/<cid>`, hand that to the agent. The issuer
  is never consulted, and the agent cannot widen it back — attenuation only
  ever removes.

  Absent `cid` answers false rather than true. A caller that does not know
  which object it is checking has not asked a question this can answer, and
  the safe direction for an unanswerable authorization question is no."
