  "`permits?` decides with the partial order, not with string surgery.

  The three directions below are one test each because they fail
  independently: an exact grant must still work (or every existing caller
  breaks), a wildcard grant must now work (it did not, and that was the
  defect), and a wildcard at one apex must NOT reach another (that is the
  boundary the change could have destroyed while making the other two pass)."
