(ns kotobase.biscuit-grant-attenuation-test
  "A holder narrows a token offline, and the reader the live surfaces use
  honours the narrowing.

  This is the property the whole unattended-agent design rests on: one human
  act mints a root-signed Biscuit with an expiry, the holder appends a block to
  narrow it, hands that to an agent, and the agent acts with nobody present --
  bounded, and unable to widen back. `kotobase.biscuit-grant` is the reader the
  four kotobase query surfaces and the API gateway decide with.

  Measured 2026-09-01: nothing tested it. Four test files exercise this reader
  and every one of them mints a SINGLE block. `biscuit.wire/append-block` says
  the same thing about itself -- until 2026-08-31 the library could read an
  attenuated token and not write one, so the claim that a holder could narrow a
  token we minted rested on the format rather than on anything measured.

  So the assertions below go through the real wire path rather than a
  hand-built grant map, and the one that carries the weight is not that a
  narrowed token still reads -- it is that the narrowed token has LOST what it
  narrowed away, and that appending cannot put it back."
