(ns grant.schedule-deadline-test
  "Every `:aiueos/schedule` in this tree declares its own `:deadline-ms`.

  ## Why this gate exists

  `grant.manifest/normalize-schedule` derives

      cycle-ms    (or (:cycle-ms sched) 1)
      period-ms   (or (:period-ms sched) cycle-ms)
      deadline-ms (or (:deadline-ms sched) period-ms)

  so **a manifest that declares a schedule and omits `:deadline-ms` gets a
  millisecond-scale wall deadline** — its period, or 1 ms if it did not name a
  period either. `default-wall-deadline-ms` (30,000) never applies to it,
  because that default is only for manifests with no schedule at all.

  ADR-0055: `launcher_test`'s fixture said `{:period-ms 3 :cycle-ms 1}` to test
  cycle arithmetic, inherited a 3 ms deadline, and executed Chicory under it.
  It passed 425 times in isolation and failed twice in the full suite at load
  average 99, because 3 ms is not a scheduling budget, it is a coin flip about
  what else the machine is doing.

  The derivation is defensible — a task due every 3 ms that takes 7 ms *is*
  overrunning — so this gate does not change it. It requires the number to be
  written down, because the surprising part is that omitting it does not mean
  \"no deadline\"."

;; This gate arrived from aiueos on 2026-08-22 with the code it scans. It is a
;; copy rather than a move: five `:aiueos/schedule` literals are still in
;; aiueos and twenty-two came here, so both trees need the check and neither
;; can run it over the other. `aiueos.schedule-deadline-test` lowered its
;; evidence floor from 15 to the measured 5 at the same time -- lowering a
;; floor without following the corpus is how a gate goes from checking
;; twenty-seven things to checking five and still reports green.
;;
;; `test/aiueos/contract_test.cljc` was exempted in the original until
;; 2026-08-21, when the
;; decision plane moved to kotoba-lang/grant (root ADR-2608219500) and took the
;; file with it. The exemption is removed rather than repointed: this gate scans
;; THIS repository, and an entry naming a file in another one would be a hole
;; that no scan here can open or close. Grant's copy of those fixtures is
;; covered by grant's own suite. This test noticing is the reason the removal
;; is deliberate -- `the-exemptions-still-exist-and-still-need-exempting`
;; refused to pass with a name that no longer resolves.
