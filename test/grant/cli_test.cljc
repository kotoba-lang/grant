;; ENTIRELY JVM-only, and the reason is one function.
;;
;; Every test here needs `cli/read-contract`, which loads
;; `resources/aiueos/cli.edn` off the CLASSPATH. That function is
;; `#?(:clj ...)` and its own docstring says what the CLJS story is meant to
;; be -- "CLJS callers should parse `resources/aiueos/cli.edn` themselves and
;; pass the map to `validate-contract`/`command-result`" -- but nothing in
;; this repository provides that seam, so nothing can call it.
;;
;; Until it exists this file is wrapped rather than left to blow up during
;; analysis: unguarded, `(def contract (cli/read-contract))` at the top level
;; made the whole namespace fail to LOAD on ClojureScript, which reads as
;; "this file does not exist" rather than "this file needs a resource".
;;
;; What that costs is worth stating plainly: `cli/command-result`,
;; `cli/parse-argv` and `cli/dispatch` are pure decision code and have ZERO
;; second-runtime coverage, not because they are unportable but because their
;; ARGUMENT is unreachable. Closing that needs a portable resource seam, which
;; is a design decision, not a test fix. See `run-tests.cljs`.
