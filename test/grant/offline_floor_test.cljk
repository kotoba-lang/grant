(ns grant.offline-floor-test
  "What this machine can still do with its uplink down — as one test rather
  than four sentences.

  ADR-0041 decision 5 listed the floor: **boot to a verified kernel, verify its
  own enrolment, refuse admission of anything not already admitted, and keep
  appending to its local audit chain.** ADR-0060 turned the first clause into a
  QEMU gate and said the other three were still unasserted. This is them
  (ADR-0066).

  ## What is new here, honestly

  Each piece is individually covered elsewhere: `grant.enroll-test`,
  `grant.broker-test`, `grant.audit-test`. **What nothing asserted is the
  conjunction under the one condition that matters** — that these hold with the
  network gone, and that the network staying gone is itself refused rather than
  silently degraded.

  Every fixture here carries `:aiueos.policy/net-allow #{}` and no trust
  anchors. Not because those functions consult the network — they are pure
  decisions and do not — but because a floor is a claim about a machine in a
  state, and the state has to be in the test or the claim is about nothing."
